# ppx_bitstring

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xguerin/ppx_bitstring.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xguerin/ppx_bitstring)

PPX plugin for the OCAML OPAM bitstring package.

## Please note

This extension has been merged in [bitstring](https://github.com/xguerin/bitstring), officially
replacing the original `camlp4` extension. This repository is now **unmaintained**.

## Overview

The PPX extension is called `ppx_bitstring`. It aims at eventually being a drop-in replacement of the bitstring `ocamlp4` extension.

## Installation

`ppx_bitstring` is available on `opam`:

```bash
opam install ppx_bitstring
```

## Syntax

Usage example with the `match` PPX extension:

```ocaml
match%bitstring bs with
| {| 1 : 1
   ; a : 2
   ; b : 16 : bigendian
   ; ...
   |} -> (* Do something *)
| {| _ |} -> (* Do something else *)
```

Usage example with the PPX extension for constructing bitstrings using the `let` syntax:

```ocaml
let%bitstring my_bitstring =
  {| 1 : 1
   ; a : 2
   ; b : 16 : bigendian
   ; ...
   |} in (* Do something here *)
```
Usage example with the PPX extension for constructing bitstrings using the constructor syntax:

```ocaml
let my_bitstring = [%bitstring
  {| 1 : 1
   ; a : 2
   ; b : 16 : bigendian
   ; ...
   |}] in (* Do something here *)
```

The pattern syntax is the same as the one of the [original extension](http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/bitstring/html/Bitstring.html).

## Additional features

### `map` qualifier

This extension also supports a `map` qualifier which applies a lambda to a parsed value and stores the result in the field name:

```ocaml
{| field : size : map (fun v -> do_something_with v) }|
```

Which is equivalent to:

```ocaml
let field = (fun v -> do_something_with v) temporary_parsed_field
```

The `map` and `bind` qualifiers are mutually exclusive.

### Pattern matching using `function`

This extension adds support for pattern matching using the `function` keyword:

```ocaml
let pattern_matcher = function%bitstring
| {| 1 : 1
   ; a : 2
   ; b : 16 : bigendian
   ; ...
   |} -> (* Do something *)
| {| _ |} -> (* Do something else *)
```

## Error reporting

This extension point supports error reporting. However, the algorithm is rather crude and the best results are obtained by following these rules :

1. Statements should not be split over multiple lines. However, multiple statements per lines are supported.
2. Statement separators should be placed *before*, and not *after* the statement.

## Contribute

### Implementation details

* Uses `ocaml-migrate-parsetree` to make it forward and backward compatible.
* Uses `jbuilder` as compilation system.

### Code generation

To see the parse tree of a ML file:

```bash
ocamlc -dparsetree foo.ml
```

To see the output of a development version of the extension:

```bash
ocamlfind opt -package bitstring -thread -dsource -ppx '_build/default/.ppx/ppx_bitsring/ppx.exe --as-ppx' foo.ml
```
